            <strong>Episode 5:</strong> <a href="../s01e05">Stable Diffusion...in Space!</a>
            <p>
                In this final episode in space we try out AI image generation with Stable Diffusion. Ben creates a rather silly experiment
                to use HTML image accessibility text as the prompt to create AI generated images, which are then swapped in place on a web page using a
                combination of an image replacement web component, a Node.js server, a Chrome extension, and of course, a local copy of Stable Diffusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before hopping over to our first website to try (SimplyRecipes.com), we sit down with Christian Cantrell, who is VP of Product at Stability.ai
                to talk about AI and creativity.
            </p>

            <strong>Episode 4:</strong> <a href="../s01e04">Web Music and Component Style...in Space!</a>
            <p>
                In this episode we explore different ways of playing music, whether its through the Web MIDI API, Tone.js, and even using pitch
                detection using the Web Audio API. We don't build the music practice application shown, but we explore these audio concepts that the
                web app uses by making small demos.
            </p>
            <p>
                We finish off these demos by making them into Lit Reactive controllers, but also turn to our guest Cassondra Roberts for advice
                to style the application.
            </p>

            <strong>Episode 3:</strong> <a href="../s01e03">Pose Capture with Tensorflow...in Space!</a>
            <p>
                In this episode we dive into pose capture and pose visualization on a video or webcam using Tensorflow.js.
                Luckily we are joined by developer advocate Jason Mayes from the Tensorflow team to get us up to speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, some of the TFJS libraries can't be pulled in as normal ES modules, and
                this causes our "Web Compon-o-tron" to break down. So, we're forced to make the pose capture components ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is fine, though, because there are some good problems that come up when building a complicated component like this one.
                We find that in order to do video playback we need to tweak our web-dev-server configuration a bit, we learn about subclassing events,
                and explore slots as a way to add non-essential or optional UI. Also, without really any UI in our main components, we avoid helper
                libraries like Lit and go completely vanilla with our Web Components.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, we attempt to use Rollup, not as a final build step, but to bundle the Tensorflow packages that crashed the "Web Compon-o-tron" and use them as trouble-free ES modules in
                our development environment.

            <strong>Episode 2:</strong> <a href="../s01e02">Real-world issues and Doodles...in Space!</a>
            <p>
                In Episode 2 we are joined by Merl, the author of Shader Doodle. Shader Doodle is a fantastic Web Component
                that lets you author WebGL based computer graphics without all the headache of setting up your canvas,
                and managing lots of obscure WebGL program code. You simply focus on a fragment, and maybe a vertex shader
                for the more complex scenes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, we'll be creating another entire application from scratch with Lit, Web Dev Server, and Adobe's
                Spectrum Web Components. This time however, we'll be flexing Web Dev Server's muscles a bit. The application
                in episode one may have a been a bit too perfect. Our episode two application will explore some more
                complicated setup as well be using Typescript, using (or pretending to use) real CSS files - no more CSS in JS.
                We'll also have some unexpected hiccups with some libraries we use some extra Web Dev Server features to
                step in and save the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, can AI have hurt feelings? Our "Web Compon-o-tron" might be a tad upset because Merl's Shader Doodle
                is already a Web Component, and we won't be requesting it's services this episode.

                <strong>Episode 0:</strong> <a href="../s01e00">Introducing Web Components...in Space!</a>
                <p>
                    Web Components have been around in some form or another for a decade. But only in the past two years
                    have they really taken off and became a formidable tool in your front-end tech stack. Ben talks a bit
                    about their history, how they became fun to work with, and issues a dire warning and wild speculation
                    concerning their explosive growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This all leads to why Ben is up in space. And it makes perfect sense. No, really, it does.
