        <strong>Episode 0:</strong> <a href="../s01e00">Introducing Web Components...in Space!</a>
        <p>
            Web Components have been around in some form or another for a decade. But only in the past two years
            have they really taken off and became a formidable tool in your front-end tech stack. Ben talks a bit
            about their history, how they became fun to work with, and issues a dire warning and wild speculation
            concerning their explosive growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            This all leads to why Ben is up in space. And it makes perfect sense. No, really, it does.

            <strong>Episode 1:</strong> <a href="../s01e01">First steps and Halftones...in Space!</a>
            <p>
                Dmitry Baranovskiy joins us for our very first episode. We'll talk about his method of creating
            halftone patterns, as well as his other experiments on ObservableHQ. We'll also go big with this first
            episode and create an entire application using Lit, Web Dev Server, and Adobe's Spectrum Web Components.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to our AI powered friend, the "Web Compon-o-tron", Dmitry's halftone experiments have been turned
                into a real Web Component we can use to create and render halftone patterns using a sample set of images,
                ones we upload, or even your live webcam stream!
            </p>

            <strong>Episode 2:</strong> <a href="../s01e02">Real-world issues and Doodles...in Space!</a>
            <p>
                In Episode 2 we are joined by Merl, the author of Shader Doodle. Shader Doodle is a fantastic Web Component
                that lets you author WebGL based computer graphics without all the headache of setting up your canvas,
                and managing lots of obscure WebGL program code. You simply focus on a fragment, and maybe a vertex shader
                for the more complex scenes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, we'll be creating another entire application from scratch with Lit, Web Dev Server, and Adobe's
                Spectrum Web Components. This time however, we'll be flexing Web Dev Server's muscles a bit. The application
                in episode one may have a been a bit too perfect. Our episode two application will explore some more
                complicated setup as well be using Typescript, using (or pretending to use) real CSS files - no more CSS in JS.
                We'll also have some unexpected hiccups with some libraries we use some extra Web Dev Server features to
                step in and save the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, can AI have hurt feelings? Our "Web Compon-o-tron" might be a tad upset because Merl's Shader Doodle
                is already a Web Component, and we won't be requesting it's services this episode.
