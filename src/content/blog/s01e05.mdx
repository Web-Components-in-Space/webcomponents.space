        <strong>Interview with Christian Cantrell</strong>
        <p>
            Ben sits down with Christian Cantrell who describes his day-job as the intersection of creativity and AI. He's the VP of Product for Stability.ai. We chat about
            how Stable Diffusion could be changing creative output, and delve into his writing process using image generation. We also talk a bit about Stability.ai and it's
            role in offering APIs to empower all of this.

        <strong>Show &amp; Tell</strong>
        <p>
            Due to unforeseen circumstances, Ben and his space lab come crashing back down to Earth. An effort is made to depict this with AI generated art
            using Stable Diffusion. Once Ben is in the safety of his home office, he talks about running Stable Diffusion locally on an M1 based Macbook Pro,
            using Node.js as a server to make the call into Python and Stable Diffusion, and finally replacing an image tag on a web page with a custom made Web
            Component that loads the AI generated image. All of this is done with a hand rolled Chrome Extension. We'll cover it all!

        <strong>Orange Breakfast Rolls</strong>
        <p>
            In this video, we turn to simplyrecipes.com and their recipe for orange breakfast rolls. We use our new Chrome Extension to swap images with those
            generated by Stable Diffusion using Simply Recipe's own accessibility text.
