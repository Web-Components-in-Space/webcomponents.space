                Episode 0 is a place for any miscellaneous, short videos that fall outside of our
                normal episodes. Someday soon, there may be short interviews with folks from the WC
                ecosystem, but for now, we have the animated show intro and a video describing why
                I'm in space exploring and experimenting with web components.

            <p>
                Web Components have been around in some form or another for a decade. But only in the past two years have they really taken off and became a formidable tool in your front-end tech stack. Ben talks a bit about their history, how they became fun to work with, and issues a dire warning and wild speculation concerning their explosive growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                This all leads to why Ben is up in space. And it makes perfect sense. No, really, it does.
